# Customer Segments

This is a data science project using unsupervised learning and customer data from a mail-order company. Unsupervised machine learning is used to examine patterns in the customers and to compare these to the general population. The entire process, from examining and cleaning the data to the conclusions, is documented in both the Jupyter Notebook format and as an export in HTML.
